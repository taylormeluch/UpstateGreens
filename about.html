						<p>Hi, my name is Jason McCabe, and I appreciate you taking a look at Upstate Greens.  My wife and I launched our urban farm in late 2015 and have been enjoying efficiently producing natural foods for our customers.  I am a veteran of the United State Marine Corps, and have joined the Veteran Farmers Coalition as a veteran food producer.</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, I was a bank examiner for over 10 years with the Federal Reserve.  I was driven to enter into the local food movement after I had a front seat view of the consolidation and near collapse of the financial industry and decided I could impact our community more through good nutrition.  So we set out on a journey to decide what our best production methods would be and determined microgreens and hydroponically grown baby and leafy greens, as well as herbs.  We are excited to let y'all know we are currently outfitting a 40' refrigerated shipping container to hold our indoor urban garden.  We would love to give anyone a tour with advanced notice.</p>

							<p>We have the Homegrown by Heroes certificate, that certifies I am a veteran producer.  We have applied for and are eagerly awaiting the Certified SC Grown certificate.  Lastly although we are not a big enough producer to gain the Organic label, we do use all natural growing methods, organic soils and feed, and non treated seed.</p>

							<p>We thank you for your support.  We listed where you can find our product in the menu, and just know we are in the process of applying for farmer's markets and will have them listed soon.  Until then feel free to contact us and set up a personalized order.  Have a wonderful day!
							</p>
							<p>Peace,</p>
